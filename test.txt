With Jekyll, we’ll be able to process SCSS (Sass) files into CSS (.scss -> .css), and Markdown into HTML (.md -> .html). No additional task runners or Terminal commands are required!

There are a few important things to know about the Jekyll file system.

The “distribution” folder is called _site. This is what the static site generator generates! Never place any files in that folder; they will be deleted and overwritten.
The _sass folder is for Sass partials. Every file in here should begin with an underscore, and it will compile into the css folder.
Any file or folder placed into the main directory will compile into the _site directory as-is.
